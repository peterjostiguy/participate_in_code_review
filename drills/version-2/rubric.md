Passing requires thoughtful comments that address 4/5 of the following issues

## Comments should address

* [ ] Code only works for a menu with two categories
* [ ] makeMenu() should be broken down into several functions
* [ ] Unnecessary variables declared (set menu = data then uses data instead of menu)
* [ ] Calls unnecessary functions in doc.ready. addItem, subTotal, addTax, total aren't dependent on the DOM
* [ ] Remove console.logs

## Style

* [ ] Comments are positive/neutral in tone
* [ ] Comments clearly address a specific issue
* [ ] Comments should ask for something that can be measured

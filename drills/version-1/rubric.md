Passing requires thoughtful comments that address 4/6 of the issues below.

## Comments should address

* [ ] Make functions more modular. pM() should be two functions; one that fetches the data, one that appends. Many others sort the data and then append and can be split up similarly
* [ ] Fix Indentation in doc.ready
* [ ] Unclear Function Names (pM() specifically)
* [ ] Unclear Variable Names in postObject
* [ ] Remove variables from the global scope
* [ ] Encapsulate math functions in a class Register (for example)

## Style

* [ ] Comments are positive/neutral in tone
* [ ] Comments clearly address a specific issue
* [ ] Comments should ask for something that can be measured

# Example 1

Examine the code in sample.js and provide feedback and provide positive, thorough feedback.

- If you haven't already, fork/clone this repo
- In the app directory, copy the code from sample.js to the empty reviewed.js
- Submit a pull request to the base fork! This is where you'll review and submit comments.
- Do a quick overview of the sample code (in the github pull request review!)
- Go back and look for style issues
- As you find errors, insert a comment in the code in github. You can do this by hovering over the line that needs work. A blue plus should appear, which you can click to add a comment.
- When you've completed your comment, click "start review" the first time, then "add review comment" each time after that.
- Go back through the code and look for syntax issues, leaving comments as you go
- When you're finished reviewing, go to the upper right hand of the review pane and click the green "Review Changes"
- Select "Comment" then "Submit Review" 

Notes:
- You don't have to make the changes to the code! Just provide constructive feedback, the developer will incorporate your changes after review.

- The provided code samples are snippets and not necessarily complete- don't worry about things like missing "requires" or functions being called that aren't defined.
